💡 How It Works
The navbar starts transparent and becomes solid with a shadow when scrolled.

Menu items animate on hover with an underline effect.

On smaller screens, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu.

Clicking nav links scrolls smoothly to sections.

A scroll spy highlights the active section's link.

A dark mode toggle allows theme switching dynamically.
